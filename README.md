Hereâ€™s how to structure **Experiment 10** for a report or README:

---

### **EXPERIMENT - 10**

**Aim of the Experiment:**  
To implement a basic recommendation system using **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** and cosine similarity, based on user ratings for movies.

---

### **Tasks Performed**  

1. Create a user-item matrix from a given dataset of user movie ratings.  
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.  
3. Use **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** to factorize the user-item matrix.  
4. Compute cosine similarity between user preferences and movie features for recommendations.  
5. Generate personalized movie recommendations.

---

### **Code Implementation**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF

# Create a dataset
data = {
    'user_id': [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3],
    'movie_id': [101, 102, 103, 101, 102, 103, 101, 102, 103],
    'rating': [5, 4, 3, 4, 5, 3, 3, 4, 5]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a user-item matrix
user_item_matrix = pd.pivot_table(df, values='rating', index='user_id', columns='movie_id')

# Split data into training and testing sets
train_matrix, test_matrix = train_test_split(user_item_matrix, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Apply Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
nmf_model = NMF(n_components=2, random_state=42)
nmf_model.fit(train_matrix)

# Function to make recommendations
def make_recommendations(user_id, num_recommendations):
    user_factors = nmf_model.transform(train_matrix)[user_id - 1].reshape(1, -1)
    movie_factors = nmf_model.components_.T
    movie_similarities = cosine_similarity(user_factors, movie_factors).flatten()
    recommended_movies = np.argsort(-movie_similarities)[:num_recommendations]
    return recommended_movies

# Generate recommendations for a specific user
user_id = 1
num_recommendations = 3
recommended_movies = make_recommendations(user_id, num_recommendations)

print(f"Recommended movies for user {user_id}: {recommended_movies}")
```

---

### **Steps Explained**

1. **Dataset Creation**:  
   - Created a sample dataset with `user_id`, `movie_id`, and `rating` to simulate user preferences for movies.

2. **User-Item Matrix**:  
   - Transformed the dataset into a **user-item matrix** where rows represent users and columns represent movies, with ratings as values.

3. **Data Splitting**:  
   - Split the user-item matrix into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

4. **Matrix Factorization using NMF**:  
   - Applied **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** to decompose the matrix into two smaller matrices:
     - **User factors**: Represent user preferences.
     - **Movie factors**: Represent movie features.

5. **Cosine Similarity for Recommendations**:  
   - Calculated cosine similarity between user preferences and movie features to determine the most relevant movies for a user.
   - Recommended movies based on the highest similarity scores.

---

### **Sample Output**

#### **Recommended Movies**
```
Recommended movies for user 1: [0, 1, 2]
```
(*Note: The movie indices correspond to the positions of the movies in the user-item matrix.*)

---

### **Conclusion**  
This experiment demonstrates how to build a simple recommendation system using NMF and cosine similarity. Such systems are widely used in applications like e-commerce, streaming platforms, and online services to provide personalized suggestions.

# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae:.2f}")
print(f"RÂ² Score: {r2:.2f}")

# Visualize the actual vs. predicted house prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred, alpha=0.5)
plt.plot([min(y_test), max(y_test)], [min(y_test), max(y_test)], color='red', linestyle='--')
plt.title('Actual vs Predicted House Prices')
plt.xlabel('Actual Prices')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Prices')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

---

### **Steps Explained**

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:  
   - The **California Housing Dataset** is loaded using the `fetch_california_housing()` function from `sklearn`.
   - Features (`X`) and target (`y`) are stored in separate DataFrames.

2. **Data Splitting**:  
   - The dataset is split into **80% training data** and **20% testing data** using `train_test_split`.

3. **Model Training**:  
   - A linear regression model is created using `LinearRegression` from `sklearn`.
   - The model is trained on the training dataset using the `.fit()` method.

4. **Model Evaluation**:  
   - Predictions are made on the test dataset using the `.predict()` method.
   - Performance metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **RÂ² Score** are calculated:
     - **MAE** indicates the average magnitude of errors between actual and predicted values.
     - **RÂ² Score** explains how well the model fits the data.

5. **Visualization**:  
   - A scatter plot shows the relationship between actual and predicted house prices.
   - A red diagonal line represents perfect predictions, aiding visual comparison.

---

### **Sample Output**

#### **Performance Metrics**
```
Mean Absolute Error: 0.53
RÂ² Score: 0.61
```

#### **Visualization**
- The scatter plot displays actual vs. predicted house prices, with the red dashed line representing the ideal fit.

---

### **Conclusion**  
This experiment demonstrates the application of linear regression in predicting house prices based on features from the California Housing dataset. While the model achieves a moderate RÂ² score, further improvements can be made by experimenting with feature engineering, data scaling, or alternative algorithms.
